Mark One Laboratory Extensions (M.O.L.E.)

Are your Mk1 command pods gathering dust? Wish you had a space station earlier in your career? Want to fly more than one kerbal at a time? Then the Mark One Laboratory Extensions (MOLE) are for you! Give your Mk1 command pod a new lease on life by adding a back seat module for an additional kerbal. Then add a docking tunnel system with integrated RCS and parachute for making rendezvous and docking easier. When you're ready for the next step, try out the Mk1.2 "Brumby" 2-seat command pod. Create a simple disposable space station by adding a Mark One Laboratory Extension, power module, and SPF-8 solar panels, and launch it on the 1.875m line of Titan fuel tanks powered by the LV-T270 "Fulcrum" engine. For a longer endurance station, add a Mark One Habitat, or if you're ready to try docking maneuvers, bring up a mini station hub. Your stations can even include the DenEye Space Telescope for, uh, astronomy! Yeah, that's it!

MOLE is a stand-alone parts pack with optional support for Real Chute, KIS/KAS, kOS, CactEye Telescopes Continued, Kerbal Snacks, TAC Life Support, USI-LS, and more.

Real World Inspiration

Back in the 1960s, the USAF had a military space program, and one of its projects was the Manned Orbiting Laboratory (MOL). MOL was designed as a spy satellite (KH-10 Dorian) disguised as a military research station. One of the cool things about it is that the Gemini spacecraft was already attached to the station when it launched. The Air Force flew a mockup into orbit once, but then the program was cancelled.

---REVISION HISTORY---

0.4.3 The difficult we do today, the impossible is in R&D

This update delivers some part revisions, a new radial docking port, and some bug fixes.

New Part
- Added the Mk1 Radial Docking Port. It is compatible with the Mk1 Docking Port, Clamp-O-Tron Jr. and can be radially attached. It doesn't have a drogue chute.

MOLE
- Once you've unlocked Advanced Exploration, The MOLE can serve as a Mobile Processing Laboratory (at reduced capacity) or as the basic research lab. You'll have to configure the MOLE in the VAB/SPH before launch, and you can't reconfigure it after launch. If you have Pathfinder installed, then as before, you can configure the lab as a basic research lab or as any of the standard Pathfinder science labs.
NOTE: Code changes make it necessary for you to retire your existing MOLE modules.

Backseat
- Moved to Flight Control.

Interstage Service Compartment
- Retextured the sides to help emphasize the built-in radiator.
- Added cosmetic avionics boxes.
- Added aft-facing RCS ports.

1.875m Heat Shield
- Moved to Flight Control.

FCP & Mk1 Docking Port
- Resized to Size 0 (0.625m diameter). You'll need to use the VAB/SPH offset tool to flush-mount them to the Mk1 command pod's nose.
- Added forward-facing RCS ports to the FCP.

Bug Fixes
- Removed "Toggle Decals" buttons from the Coaches. Thanks for the feedback, tater! :)
- The Interstage Service Compartment is now easier to attach to your vessels. Thanks again, tater! :)
- Fixed an issue with the MOLE where it wasn't providing the ability to review your research.
- Fixed an issue with the Cryo Engines template that was adding liquid hydrogen to everything. Thanks kerbas_ad_astra! :)

0.4.2 For Science!

Looks like I got ahead of myself with the version numbering and features. This release straightens it all out. I'm also happy to report that with this update, MOLE Phase 1 is complete! I'm now working on MOLE Phase 2, which adds the 1.875m station components, and is about halfway done.

New Parts
- Added the MOLE, a 1.875m science lab. It can perform basic science by consuming ResearchKits. A 2.5m version is planned. The IVA is on backorder- artist's block.
  * If you have Pathfinder installed, then you can configure it for Science operations at reduced efficiency compared to the Doc Science Lab. 
  * NOTE: Unlike the Doc, you CANNOT reconfigure the MOLE during flight.
- Added the Titan Nose Cone, a 1.875m nose cone based on the stock Mk7 nose cone, but with new textures.
- Added the Titan Adapter Tank, a 1.875m to 2.5m fuel tank.
- Added the Power Module, a 1.875m station module with a Monopropellant Power Unit (MPU), MonoPropellant, and ElectricCharge.
- Added the SPF-8 solar panel; this large, early model solar panel is roughly equal to 8 OX-4 solar panels and costs about as much.
- Added the O-2 "Oxygen" monopropellant powered thruster. It is an OMS engine that can function as a launch abort motor in an emergency.

Mk-85 Backseat
- Adjusted the center of bouyancy. Thanks for the tips, Kerbas_ad_astra! :)
- Finished up the IVA flight controls.

Mk1 Docking Port
- Added RealChute support.
- For RealChute, the cut altitude of the drogue chute equals the deployment altitude of the main chute.
NOTE: With RealChute installed, you won't see the staging icon for the docking port until you right-click the part and select Enable Staging. This is a KSP/RealChute issue that arises from the combined docking port and parachute.
- If you DON'T have RealChute installed, the Mk1 Docking Port can now auto-cut the drogue chute. By default, the cut altitude (700 meters) equals the deploy altitude of the FCP.

Titan Instrument Unit
- Revised the part description and made the crew tube height flush with the structural ring.

Sample Craft
- Added the Titan ATV. It is configured to carry LiquidFuel, Oxidizer, MonoPropellant, and has two Coaches ready to accept parts stored via KIS.
- Added the Titan MOLE. This craft is a single-use space station consisting of the Appaloosa and the new Mark One Laboratory Extension (MOLE), along with the new solar panels and station power module.
- Made some minor updates to the K-20 Kestrel.

Bug Fixes
- Fixed issues with the FCP not working with RealChute.
- Fixed (again) the FCP's misreported height issue in VAB/SPH engineering report.
- Adjusted the place where rocket exhaust comes out of the LV-T270 Fulcrum.
- The Backseat MPU should properly consume MonoPropellant while generating ElectricCharge now.

0.4.1 
- Updated to latest WildBlueTools

0.3 Remember the Titans!

This update introduces a bunch of new parts. Chief among them is the Titan series of fuel tanks and associated hardware. The textures are based upon the Titan II Gemini Launch Vehicle. This release also redesigns the Flight Control Package slightly to be virtually the same diameter as the Mk1 command pod's upper attachment node. You also get a complementary docking port since the Clamp-O-Tron Jr no longer fits on the FCP. Finally, the Backseat received some minor tweaks.

New Parts
- Added the Titan series of fuel tanks. They are 1.875m in diameter and come in three sizes: the 450, 900, and 1800. These tanks are fully compatible with the Wild Blue Industries' resource template system, and can hold parts if converted to storage and KIS is installed.
- Added the Titan II series of fuel tanks. They are 2.5m in diameter and come in four sizes. They're equal to the Rockomax 8, 16, 32, and 64 but are also fully compatible with the WBI resource template system. The Titan II series is a KSP version of the real-world Titan "Barbarian" variant.
- Added the Coach 225, a 1.875m logistics module.
- Added the Coach 300, a 2.5m logistics module.
- Added the 1.875m Payload Faring. This is just a modified stock faring that's been resized for 1.875m diameter.
- Added the Titan Instrument Unit. This is a 1.875m probe core/gyro assembly combo. It can be upgraded as technology improves, and includes a kOS CPU if the kOS mod is installed.
- Added the Twin Engine Coupler. This 1.875m engine mount has space for a pair of 1.25m engines and carries a small amount of fuel.
- Added the Quad Engine Coupler. This is a 2.5m engine with space for four 1.25m engines, and it too carries a small amount of fuel.
- Added the Short Interstage Adapter. This 1.875m adapter lets you attach 1.25m diameter engines.
- Added the Long Interstage Adapter. This 1.875m adapter lets you attach 1.25m diameter engines.
- Added the Mk1 Docking Port, specially designed for the Mk1 command pod and the Flight Control Package. It is fully compatible with the Clamp-O-Tron Jr, and it contains a small drogue chute. It cannot be radially attached, however.
- Added the LV-T270 "Fulcrum" rocket engine. It is designed after the stock LV-T series of rocket engines.

FCP
- Redesigned the Flight Control Package to be virtually the same diameter as the Mk1 command pod's upper attachment node. I like the slimmer look. :)
- Fixed an issue that allowed RCS thrusters to work when you haven't unlocked the proper tech node.

Backseat
- Added support for kOS if the mod is installed.
- Removed RocketParts resource; the Coach can bring them up if needed.
- Fixed the Supplies resource for when USI-LS is installed.

Sample Craft
- Added several sample craft. You can find them in the MOLE/SampleCraft/VAB folder.

0.2 Further Developments
This update brings some tweaks, a new internal view, and a complete redesign of the Interstage Service Compartment.

MK85 Heat Shield
- Tweaked the heat shield mass and Ablator to be inline with stock heat shields.

FCP
- Adjusted drag curve for the FCP. Combined with the heat shield change, this should help with self-aligning the capsule for re-entry.

SD-18 & SD-25
- Made some minor mesh improvements to the SD-18 and SD-25 adapters to make them look nicer. I think I'm finally satisfied with their look. :) NOTE: As a reminder, you can toggle the staging icon off and use the adapter/decoupler as an adapter only. And you can flip them around to adapt to different sizes.

Backseat
- Added IVA for the Backseat. It has support for stock props and ASET props. Control layout is a work in progress, but it totally beats the placeholder IVA. Cockpit lights are named CockpitLight, just in case somebody adds an ASET cockpit light switch. ;)
- Added USI-LS support to the Backseat for when USI Life Support is installed. It has 15 days of supplies for two kerbals (you get a total of 30 days with the Mk1 pod and the Backseat due to how USI-LS works).
- The SAS level will be automatically upgraded as technology improves: Advanced Flight Control, level 2; Specialized Control, level 3. Sandbox mode gives level 3.
- Added camera transforms: cameraTransformFront, cameraTransformLeft, cameraTransformRight, cameraTransformBottom. These are for Raster Prop Monitor cameras.

Appaloosa Interstage Service Compartment (ISC)
- Added side doors that you can open to access equipment inside of the compartment for when the aft end is blocked by another stage component.
- Added RCS thruster ports (as long as you've unlocked Advanced Flight Control).
- Added a decoupler; arrows show which way it decouples.
- Added an active radiator that can be switched on and off.
- Added a crew tube that can be toggled (it's largely cosmetic).

Other
- Added bulkhead profiles courtesy of kerbas-ad-astra. Thanks! :)
- Added support for Connected Living Spaces to the Backseat, FCP, WBM-400, Mk85 Heat Shield, SD-18, ISC, and SD-25, courtesy of kerbas-ad-astra. Thanks! :)
- Experiment data corrections courtesy of kerbas-ad-astra. Thanks! :)

0.1.7

WB400
- Added resource switcher; you can now switch between different resource types just like with other Wild Blue Industries' storage tanks.
- The default template is the original resource layout with LiquidFuel, Oxidizer, and MonoPropellant.
- If you have KIS installed, then the WB400 can be converted to storage. Simply cycle through the templates until you find Storage.
