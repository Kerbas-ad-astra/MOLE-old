description = The Appaloosa Interstage Service Compartment (ISC) bears a striking resemblance to a small WadeCo swimming pool, right down to the siding and bracing. That similarity is purely coincidental according to the Wild Blue Industries' sales reps. The service compartment is quite good at protecting equipment inside from outside temperatures- so long as you keep the open end out of the airstream.
