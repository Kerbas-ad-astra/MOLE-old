	description = Originally created as a boilerplate test article for the Mk1-85, Wild Blue's engineers realized that they could outfit the boilerplate into a structural adapter. It has a crew tunnel built into its center and it can even store some rocket fuel thanks to a hidden fuel tank. The marketing team still can't figure out the engineers' facination with crew tubes. They're hoping it's just a phase.
